# Abstract

This directory contains notebooks that use several regressions algorithms of Spark ML 
to predict network performance. 

# Getting Started

See the notebook [regressors.ipynb](https://github.com/fleapapa/Network_performance_prediction/blob/master/spark/regressors.ipynb)

# Requirements

* Python 2.7, Jupyter Notebook
* [Spark ML](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html)

This project uses the same data samples as in [network_profile_recommender project](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_profile_recommender).
