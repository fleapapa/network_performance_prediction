# Abstract

This directory contains notebooks that use several regressions algorithms of scipy sklean 
library to predict network performance. 

# Getting Started

See the notebook [regressors.ipynb](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_performance_prediction/blob/master/sklearn/regressors.ipynb).

Another notebook [regressor+PCA.ipynb](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_performance_prediction/blob/master/sklearn/regressor%2BPCA.ipynb) applies PCA to data samples before running the regressors.

The other notebook [regressors-no-avg-delta](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_performance_prediction/blob/master/sklearn/regressors-no-avg-delta.ipynb) embeds time-serial information in data samples and applies the same set of regressors.

# Requirements

* Python 2.7, Jupyter Notebook
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

The notebooks use the same [data samples](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_profile_recommender/tree/master/data) as in [network_profile_recommender project](https://github.com/fleapapa/network_profile_recommender).
